# AGENTS.md

This is the authoritative control surface for all coding agents. Read this first.

`whisper-subtitle-pipeline` is a self-hosted batch subtitling & translation service for video libraries. It transcribes/translates source videos **on-device** with faster-whisper and writes SRT/VTT/JSON caption artifacts back to Backblaze B2. The primary entity is a **Subtitle Job**.

## 1. Repository Map

```
apps/web/          Next.js 16 frontend (App Router, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui)
  src/app/jobs/        Subtitle Job list (/jobs) + detail (/jobs/[id])
  src/app/library/     Scoped caption library (/library)
  src/components/jobs/ Job form (create/edit), list, detail, status badge
services/api/      FastAPI backend (layered: types/config/repo/service/runtime)
  app/repo/whisper_engine.py   faster-whisper adapter (the only ML import)
  app/service/pipeline.py      B2 -> transcribe(+translate) -> B2 orchestration
  app/service/subtitles.py     SRT / VTT / JSON formatters (pure)
  app/service/jobs.py          Job store + manifest (system of record in B2)
  app/runtime/{jobs,library}.py  Job CRUD+run + library/dashboard routes
packages/shared/   Shared TypeScript types
docs/              System of record (features, workflows, security, reliability)
docs/exec-plans/   Execution plans and tech debt tracker
infra/railway/     Deployment config
```

**Where the ML lives.** The faster-whisper / CTranslate2 dependency is imported **only** in `services/api/app/repo/whisper_engine.py` (lazily, inside functions). Storage stays on boto3 in `repo/b2_client.py`. Nothing outside `repo/` touches either SDK — enforced by `tests/test_structure.py`.

## 2. Building on the Starter Kit

This app was built from the vibe-coding-starter-kit. The following are part of the starter contract — keep them. Adapt only what the use case requires.

**Keep as-is (do not strip, rename, or replace)**
- **UI kit / design system.** `apps/web/src/components/ui/` (shadcn primitives), the design tokens in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`, and the `/design` reference page. Build new screens with these primitives; never edit the generated `components/ui/` files directly. Restyling happens through tokens in `globals.css`.
- **File Explorer.** `/files` route, `apps/web/src/app/files/`, and `apps/web/src/components/files/`. This is the full-bucket browser and stays even though `/library` adds a scoped, subtitle-domain view.
- **Upload.** `/upload` route — repurposed to upload source videos to the `source/` prefix, but the component + sidebar entry stay.
- The sidebar nav shell (Dashboard, Upload, Files, Settings + the Design System utility link).

**App-specific (added / adapted here)**
- **Jobs.** `/jobs` + `/jobs/[id]` — the Subtitle Job primary entity with full create/read/edit/delete/run lifecycle.
- **Library.** `/library` — scoped explorer over `source/` + `captions/` (complements, never replaces, `/files`).
- **Dashboard.** `/` shows subtitle-pipeline metrics (videos processed, caption files, languages, derived/source ratio, total B2 usage). All aggregations flow through `runtime -> service -> repo` and TanStack Query hooks in `apps/web/src/lib/queries.ts` — no bare `useEffect + fetch`.
- Update `docs/features/<feature>.md` in the same PR as any feature change (see §9).

## 3. Architectural Invariants

**Backend layering**: `types` -> `config` -> `repo` -> `service` -> `runtime`

- No backward imports across layers
- No `boto3` outside `repo/`
- No business logic in route handlers (`runtime/`)
- All external APIs wrapped in `repo/` adapters
- All request/response data validated at boundary (Pydantic models)
- No shared mutable state across layers

**Frontend**: shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/` are generated — never modify them.

**Data fetching**: every API call flows through TanStack Query hooks in `apps/web/src/lib/queries.ts`. No bare `useEffect + fetch` patterns. New endpoints touch three files: `runtime/<router>.py`, `lib/api-client.ts`, `lib/queries.ts`.

## 4. Quality Expectations

- **DRY** — do not duplicate logic, types, or constants. Extract shared code only when used in 2+ places.
- Structured JSON logging only — no `print()` statements
- No raw SDK calls outside `repo/` layer
- Files stay under 300 lines
- Tests added or updated for every behavior change
- Docs updated in same PR as code changes
- Lint clean before merge
- Prefer boring, composable libraries over clever abstractions
- No implicit type assumptions — use typed models

## 5. Mechanical Enforcement

| Rule | Enforced by |
|------|-------------|
| No backward imports | `tests/test_structure.py::test_no_backward_imports` |
| No boto3 outside repo/ | `tests/test_structure.py::test_boto3_only_in_repo` |
| File size < 300 lines | `tests/test_structure.py::test_file_size_limits` |
| All layers exist | `tests/test_structure.py::test_all_layers_exist` |
| No bare print() | `ruff` rule T20 |
| Import ordering | `ruff` rule I001 |
| Frontend strict equality | `eslint` rule eqeqeq |
| No unused vars | `eslint` + `ruff` rules |

## 6. Commands

```bash
# Run
pnpm dev               # start both frontend and backend
pnpm dev:web           # frontend only
pnpm dev:api           # backend only

# Test & Lint
pnpm lint              # frontend lint (eslint)
pnpm build             # frontend type check + build
pnpm lint:api          # backend lint (ruff)
pnpm test:api          # backend tests (pytest)
pnpm check:structure   # structural boundary tests
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright e2e tests
```

## 7. Agent Workflow

1. Read this file first.
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) before structural changes.
3. For non-trivial changes, create a plan in `docs/exec-plans/active/`.
4. Implement the smallest coherent change.
5. Run: `pnpm lint && pnpm lint:api && pnpm test:api && pnpm check:structure`
6. Update docs in the same PR (see §9).
7. Move completed plans to `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.
8. Only change files relevant to the task. No drive-by improvements.

## 8. Frontend Conventions

See [docs/dev-workflows.md](docs/dev-workflows.md) for full details.

## 9. Doc Update Mapping

| Change Type | Update Location |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Feature logic, inputs, outputs, tests | `docs/features/<feature>.md` |
| User journeys | `docs/app-workflows.md` |
| System layout, deployments | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Dev or testing process | `docs/dev-workflows.md` |
| Setup or scope changes | `README.md` |
| Security changes | `docs/SECURITY.md` |
| Reliability changes | `docs/RELIABILITY.md` |
| Active work plans | `docs/exec-plans/active/` |
| Known tech debt | `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` |

If documentation and implementation conflict, update docs in the same PR. Documentation rot destroys agent reliability.

## 10. Doc Map

| Topic | Location |
|-------|----------|
| System layout, data flows, boundaries | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Feature docs | [docs/features/](docs/features/) |
| User journeys | [docs/app-workflows.md](docs/app-workflows.md) |
| Engineering workflows and testing | [docs/dev-workflows.md](docs/dev-workflows.md) |
| Security principles | [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) |
| Reliability expectations | [docs/RELIABILITY.md](docs/RELIABILITY.md) |
| Execution plans | [docs/exec-plans/](docs/exec-plans/) |
| Tech debt | [docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md](docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md) |

## 11. When Unsure

- Prefer boring, stable libraries
- Prefer small PRs over large changes
- Add tests with every change
- Never bypass lint rules without explicit instruction
- Ask before making destructive or irreversible changes
